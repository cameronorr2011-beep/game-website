"""NeuroML brain_xl — measurable model profiles (PROMPT 4 P4).

Old claim: advanced ≈ 34-35M params (~140 MB). New honest plan:
  compact   768  x 6   ≈ 7-8M     (phone-safe default)
  standard  1024 x 6   ≈ 13.7M    (currently running default)
  advanced  2560 x 20  ≈ ~270M   ≈ ~1.0+ GiB fp32 policy weights — REAL
                                    architecture, real save path, honestly
                                    labeled TRAIN-LIMITED (see below).

Honesty rules enforced here:
  * parameter counts come from instantiated modules (bot_ml.param_report),
    never from comments; checkpoint BYTE counts are measured from the file.
  * target network / optimizer state / replay are reported SEPARATELY —
    the 1 GiB claim may only cover the POLICY weights file (no
    double-counting of the target net, no replay padding).
  * the Advanced profile is NEVER loaded on Android / low-RAM devices (the
    phone forces `standard`) and is never trained on the UI thread.
  * data-reality: a few tens of matches of replay cannot meaningfully train
    ~270M parameters. Advanced ships as architecture + migration + save path
    with the explicit label "train-limited until enough verified match data
    exists" — and the default profiles stay runnable everywhere.
