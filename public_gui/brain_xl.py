"""NeuroML brain_xl — measurable model profiles (PROMPT 4 P4).

Old claim: advanced ≈ 34-35M params (~140 MB). New honest plan:
  compact   768  x 6   ≈ 7-8M     small fallback
  standard  1024 x 6   ≈ 13.7M    small fallback
  extended  1408 x 8   ≈ 34M      (desktop default v27–v30)
  advanced  2560 x 20  ≈ ~270M   ≈ ~1.0+ GiB fp32 policy weights — REAL
                                    architecture, real save path, honestly
                                    labeled TRAIN-LIMITED (see below).
                                    v31: DESKTOP DEFAULT (owner asked for
                                    1 GB of neurons, brain runs on the
                                    computer only).

Honesty rules enforced here:
  * parameter counts come from instantiated modules (bot_ml.param_report),
    never from comments; checkpoint BYTE counts are measured from the file.
  * target network / optimizer state / replay are reported SEPARATELY —
    the 1 GiB claim may only cover the POLICY weights file (no
    double-counting of the target net, no replay padding).
  * v30: the phone CAN load extended AND advanced — the old hard RAM guard
    was removed at the owner's explicit request ("270M params for the phone,
    modern phones have the storage"). In its place the phone build runs a
    NATIVE PRE-FLIGHT before importing the brain: it proves the OS will
    actually grant the memory, and steps down LOUDLY (advanced -> extended
    -> standard) if it won't — never silently, never lying in the metrics.
    (v31: the mobile app is no longer shipped — computer-only operation.)
  * the Advanced profile is still label-marked "train-limited until enough
    verified match data exists" (a few tens of matches cannot meaningfully
    train ~270M params) — loading it is fine, only the expectations are
    managed; measured param/loss telemetry stays exactly as honest as before.
