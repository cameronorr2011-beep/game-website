# android_main.py — on-phone entry point for the FULL NeuroML brain.
#
# The player phone here IS the phone playing Clash Royale: no computer, no ADB,
# no WiFi pairing — the brain sees the screen via MediaProjection
# (CaptureService) and taps via the accessibility service
# (TapAccessibilityService). All learning, the coach (through the maintainer's
# zero-key mentor proxy) and the federated package-exchange loop run exactly as
# on desktop.
